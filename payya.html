<h4><u>Payyambalam Beach,</u> <u>Kannur Overview</u></h4>
<p>Located close to the Cannanore Lighthouse and Baby Beach, the entry sign to Payyambalam Beach looks very similar to a signage of an amusement park. You have to pay a nominal fee to enter this beach. One needs to take a short walk to reach the sandy beach through a path of refreshment stalls, a rusted children’s park and amusement centre. Early morning and late evening are considered best for visiting this beach when the long sandy shore remains almost deserted; thus, making it your own private place of waves and surf. This beach is an ideal evening getaway and a local favourite during holidays. Expect crowd during weekends but you can easily find your private peaceful space on this clean beach on a sunny weekday afternoon.

    The best thing about the Payyambalam Beach is that on one hand it is secluded, but on the other it is well-connected. Located at a distance of just two kilometres from the Kannur railway station, the Payyambalam Beach is one where a traveller can find ultimate serenity. Far from the maddening crowd of tourists, this quiet and secluded beach is one of the best places to visit for travellers who love to explore the most offbeat parts of a destination. There’s nothing on this beach apart from the beautiful stretch of sand and surf and a pristine environment, along with the soothing breeze coming from the sea that make this beach an amazing place to visit.</p>
<p>Thanks to the most stunning views of the ocean and the pristine nature of this beach, the Payyambalam Beach sees a huge footfall of travellers from not only different parts of the country but a lot of other parts of the world as well.

    The best way to reach the Payyambalam Beach is by road or by rail. While the Kannur town and its railway station are not more than just two kilometres away from this beach, the nearest airport to the Payyambalam Beach is the Calicut International Airport, which lies at a distance of 93 km from the beach. One of the interesting features of the Payyambalam Beach is visible right at its entrance. Hard to understand that it is the entrance to the beach, the main access to this beach is through a walking bridge on a small canal. Right after entering the beach through the bridge, on the right side, one can see an area where monuments are erected on a tiled floor. These monuments are dedicated to the lives of political leaders who belonged to Kannur. One can also see a burial place of Thiyya community, just above the beach.
    </p>
    <p>Another amazing feature of the Payyambalam Beach is its length. The beach stretches for as far as four kilometres and retains its pristine goodness throughout the way. So, there are enough opportunities for travellers to sit, laze around, take walks, relax and witness the sunset from this beach.
